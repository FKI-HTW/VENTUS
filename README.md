# VENTUS

VENTUS is a framework for collaborative prototyping of CAD-Models. Using VENTUS it is possible to edit and discuss these models in an immersive environment on a global scale in real time. Easy-to-use features, such as model transformations, annotations for providing feedback and sketching in 3D-space, allow both professionals and new users alike to utilise VENTUS for developing prototypes with colleagues or clients. The applications supports both desktop- and VR-modes and the collaboration between users on both platforms. 


The project can not only be downloaded and used as a complete application, but can also be extended to enable further developments in VR. For this, many of VENTUS' features are provided as separate Unity packages, which can be imported into any Unity project.

## Installation

The newest version of the executable application can be downloaded for windows from <a href="https://github.com/FKI-HTW/VENTUS/releases">Releases</a>.
Alternatively the source code can also be downloaded or cloned from here. The cloned project can then be opened with a supported Unity Editor version (2022.3.28+ as of 07.24) and built to a desired platform. The application starts in desktop-mode by default. VR-mode can be started from the taskbar once a supported HMD is connected and activated through an OpenXR runtime (SteamVR or Meta Quest Link is recommended).
