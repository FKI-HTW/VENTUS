In this window you can create and customise your avatar for this session. This avatar will be visible to every connected client. Customisation is possible by choosing your own username, a hairstyle, hair colour, and main colour. Your chosen main colour will be visible as the colour of your avatar’s shirt and outline when selecting models in the scene. 
After customising your avatar you can choose between the options ‘Create Session’ or ‘Join Session’ to either be the host and create a new session, or join an existing session.

In this window you can create your own session. The maximum number of users who are allowed to join the session can be changed in the first dropdown. While this session is hosted on your computer, it requires a separate server that establishes the connection between you and other users who would like to join your session. This servers’ location can be changed in the second dropdown, in case the selected default location is not suitable for your use case. To confirm your choices please click the ‘Create’ button. Once you have joined a session the scene will change and you will see a horizontal taskbar, through which you can interact with the application.

In this window you can join an already created session. To do this simply type in the join code, which you should have received from the host of the created session, or paste it in the input field using the button right next to it. The code may consist of up to 8 capital letters and numbers. To confirm your input please click the ‘Join’ button. Once you have joined a session the scene will change and you will see a horizontal taskbar, through which you can interact with the application.
