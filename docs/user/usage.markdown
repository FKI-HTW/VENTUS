All panels like the taskbar and top windows, the transform window or the input windows for annotations can be dragged to a position you prefer. When hovering over any window, you will see a light outline around it. Just press the trigger button when the outline is there, move the window to its new position while pressing the trigger button and release it wherever you would like the window to be placed for now.
