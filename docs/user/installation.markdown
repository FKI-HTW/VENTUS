## Installation

The newest version of the application can be downloaded for windows from <a href="https://github.com/FKI-HTW/VENTUS/releases">Releases</a>.
Alternatively the source code can also be downloaded or cloned from <a href="https://github.com/FKI-HTW/VENTUS">Github</a>. The downloaded project can then be opened with a supported Unity Editor version (2022.3.28+ as of 01.07.24) and build to a desired platform. The application starts in desktop-mode by default. VR-mode can be started from the taskbar once a supported HMD is connected and activated through an OpenXR runtime (SteamVR or Meta Quest Link is recommended).
