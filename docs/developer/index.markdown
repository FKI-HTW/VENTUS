## Developer Documentation

VENTUS is a framework for collaborative prototyping of CAD-Models. Using VENTUS it is possible to edit and discuss these models in an immersive environment on a global scale in real time. Easy-to-use features, such as model transformations, annotations for providing feedback and sketching in 3D-space, allow both professionals and new users alike to utilise VENTUS for developing prototypes with colleagues or clients.


In this wiki you can find information about the development of the VENTUS application and all its feature packages.
