## Installation

The newest version of the application can be downloaded for windows from <a href="https://github.com/FKI-HTW/VENTUS/releases">Releases</a>.
Alternatively the source code can also be downloaded or cloned from <a href="https://github.com/FKI-HTW/VENTUS">Github</a>. The downloaded project can then be opened with a supported Unity Editor version (2022.3.28+ as of 01.07.24) and built to a desired platform.


Various features are provided as separate packages, which will be automatically downloaded through the Unity Package Manager, once the project is opened. Documentation on these packages can be found at <a href="/VENTUS/developer/packages">Packages</a>.
